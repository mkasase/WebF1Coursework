        <h1>Literature Review: Sustainable computing</h1>
        <p>The literature that will be evaluated will answer the question what is Green computing in Business and understand the current sustainable computing issues and overcoming the problems through analysis of factors that uses IT & business interaction to introduced green business in computing with policies that sustain the environment in addition to estimate consequences after the employment of sustainable computing.</p>
        <h1>Interaction Business and computing with green alternatives</h1>
        <p> “Originally the terms information technology and information systems, before its development of the concept of the interaction between business and technology were referred to the employment of hardware and software applications that manages client data; and hardware developers and testers performed the function of scientific and mathematical calculations.” (Ullah and Lai (2013), page 2797) Written by both these authors, they’re argument that is being described is the early development before the interaction between business & technologies since information technology and systems was been able to manage client data through scientific and mathematical calculations functions performed by hardware developers and testers. However found in “Modern large-scale computing systems, such as data centres and high performance computing (HPC) clusters are severely constrained by power and cooling costs for solving extreme-scale problems.” (PANDE, P. P. (2012). page 26) So therefore the problem raised through this quote explains that his appraising the previous argument by saying since businesses relied on information technology and systems to manage client data, this creates a constraints to large scale computing systems such data centre due to the power and cooling costs affect solving extreme case problems since organisations are handling large amount of data. So therefore “People employing sustainable or green computing practices strive to minimize greenhouse gases and waste, while increasing the cost effectiveness of IT, such as computers, local area networks and data centres.” (Agarwal, S., & Nath, A. (2013), page 46) And this argument was raised both of the authors is assess the problem of Pande’s constraint in relation cooling and power costs in data centres so therefore employment of policies and renewable ideas created to assist the minimization of greenhouse gases while increase cost effectiveness in IT to ensure computer systems are maintainable and manageable.</p>
        <h1>Green business and Purposes</h1>
        <p>“Over the past 20 years, the environmental protection campaign has been gathering momentum with a variety of newly developed green concepts. Consumers who have a sense of environmental protection are known as ‘‘green consumers’’ and enterprises adopting a sense of environmental protection in their operation and production are referred to as ‘‘green businesses’ (Peattie 2001). From this quote collected from the Peattie’s perspective, this describes the concept of adoption the types of environmental options designed to create a sustainable environment by protecting the operations and productions in their products found in business.The “Creation an Environmental Policy, will provide opportunities for an organisation to review the day-to-day activities are both environmentally responsible and meet legal requirements. It also helps to keep employees informed of their environmental roles and responsibilities, lowers cost through reduced consumption and waste and helps save even more money by improving the efficiency of your processes”  (The is4profit team, 2012). From the website the is4profit team is explaining the features of creating the environmental roles and responsibilities in order for a business to save cost while reducing consumption of energy</p>
        <p>”Although organizations are changing their policies and practices to minimize their environmental impact, such efforts are generally not well organized or integrated” (Talebi, M., & Way, T. (2009) page 368). From this argument both authors are counteracting  the fact that creating an environment policy will be subjected to changes due to the organization & integration of the hardware, staff and cost in order to understand how information has been maintained in addition to handled. </p>
        <h1>Drawbacks of Green technology and overcoming the problem</h1>
        <p>“While Green IT is a game changer in addressing environmental problems facing us and there is growing support for adoption of green initiatives, there are barriers – both perceived and real – to implementing green technologies and measures”. San .M. (2013). From san’s argument exposition his idea that Green IT is able to address environmental problems, through barriers when adding green technologies and measures that are required to sustain the environment.</p>
        <p>“As population has increased, energy use has also increased. The widespread use of technology, particularly computers, means that computer power consumption is a topic of concern, with increases in computer energy consumption leading to increases in pollution and related side-effects. (Talebi, M., & Way, T. (2009). Page 363)” Talebi & way’s argument is described from their perspective of due to the population of people, more energy is being produced in technology especially computing will cause increase in pollution & side-effects from the environment. “Furthermore, since IT is a highly innovative field, the rate of obsolescence is very rapid, and the refresh cycle for IT equipment is relatively short. This creates a major environmental problem because users want to constantly update their equipment with newer, fancier ones, even though the older equipment is often still working: the disposal of all the unneeded electronic devices, which contain a lot of toxic substances.” (Venkatraman, S. S. (2011) page 100) Venkatraman’s argument is describing that IT is innovative field that cause an environmental impact due to updating system in addition to supporting the previous argument since an increase in energy affects the environment. However “An interesting study (Williams 2003) concludes that it is very important to extend the lifespan of IT equipment, as the environmental payback of recycling is rather minimal when it comes to IT equipment. Apparently the “energy investment in the life cycle of a computer is in producing its complex form rather than its physical substance.” From his final point of the argument that Williams’s quote has explained one of the methods of extending the importance of the lifecycle of the equipment so that costs can be reduced additionality since this is able to sustain the environment.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>To summarise, the points that were made from those arguments covered in this review, from interaction development of business and technology to understanding the constraint through this function, the need to implement green computing although this raises the question to cover analysis of drawbacks of green computing towards understanding their importance shows overall, this is needed ensure business using computer systems must be aware of requirement need to reduce the risk environmental damage that might affect the organisation when  handling large amounts of data.</p>
